![screenshot](./bubblesort.png)

The `#bubble_sort` method takes an `array` as an `argument` and returns the sorted `array`. 
Output Example:

```ruby
p bubble_sort([5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 8, 9, 7, 6])
## => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

The `#bubble_sort_by` method takes an `array` as an `argument`, and a `block`, and returns the sorted `array`. Output Example:

```ruby
sample = bubble_sort_by(%w[hi hello hey]) do |left, right|
  left.length - right.length
end
```
## => ["hi", "hey", "hello"]
